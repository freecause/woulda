h1. woulda

Testing is love. Especially when done with "Shoulda":http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda. Shoulda makes testing your Rails app pretty easy.

There are tons of Rails plugins and gems out there. It should be easy to test your Rails app that uses these as well. That kind of support doesn't really belong in Shoulda itself though.

That's where Woulda comes in.

h2. Installing

It's available as a gem: <pre>gem install seanhussey-woulda --source http://gems.github.com</pre>

Use it in a Rails app by placing in config/environments/test.rb:

<pre>config.gem 'seanhussey-woulda', :lib => 'woulda', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'</pre>

Woulda requires "shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda/tree/master >= 2.0.0.
